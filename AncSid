The main function of this AncSid is to identify species of ancient animals based on
next generation sequencing data. There are several key parameters that will influence
the identification accuracy including the sequencing similarity, query coverage, and the
screening scope of deamination induced mutations. We strongly recommended to use a
similarity with â‰¥98% but <100% and query coverage >96% for running this script. The
deamination based screening can be turned off, but this function will significantly
improve the ability of species identification, especially for highly damaged DNAs.
