Manual for AncSid
Version 1.0
1.	Introduction
The main function of this perl script is to identify species of ancient animals based on next generation sequencing data. There are several key parameters that will influence the identification accuracy including the sequencing similarity, query coverage, and the screening scope of deamination induced mutations. We strongly recommended to use a >98% similarity and >96% query coverage for running this script. The deamination based screening can be turned off, but this function will significantly improve the ability of species identification, especially for highly damaged DNAs. 
2.	Parameters
Parameters	Description	Parameter Type
-i	Fastq file after adapter filtration	string
-name	Sample name that used for identify different samples	string
-formatdb	Absolute path of Formatdb. If you have formatdbed database,then ignore this	string
-blastall	Blastall Absolute path	string
-Rpath	R Absolute path	string
-database	MtDNA database	string
-coveragemin	The minimal query coverage	num
-coveragemax	The maximal query coverage	num
-similaritymin	The minimal sequence similarity	num
-similaritymax	The maximal sequence similarity	num
-mutationsite	The first and last N bases that used for screening reads with the C->T and G->A changes	num
-ct_mutationnum	More than N C-to-T changes within the -mutationsite <num>. This should be used with the parameter -mutationsite	num
-ga_mutationnum	More than N G-to-A changes within the -mutationsite <num>. This should be used with the parameter -mutationsite	num
-delete	Deleting the temp files, yes or no	string
-o	The output directory	string
-h	Show the help message	string

3.	Example:
perl pipeline.pl -i path/test.fq.gz -name sample1 -formatdb path/formatdb -blastall path/blastall -Rpath path/R -database path/animal_mtDNA.fa -coveragemin 0.1 -coveragemax 1.00 -similaritymin 10 -similaritymax 100  -mutationsite 10 -ct_mutationnum 1 -ga_mutationnum 1 -delete yes -o path/
(1)	The format of test.fq.gz: This is a normal Fastq file with a format as following:
 
(2)	formatdb: This includes several files that are generated by formatdb, which are used for blast search:
 
(3)	animal_mtDNA.fa: This is the mtDNA database for ancient animals with the normal Fasta format:
